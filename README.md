=======================

Set of useful classes that might be helpful for Tapestry5 projects.

No Tapestry-IoC modules here, just use there classes as you want.

Usually you will register them as services in your AppModule manually.

[Publisher API](https://github.com/anjlab/anjlab-tapestry-commons/wiki/Publisher-API)

```java
    public static void bind(ServiceBinder binder)
    {
        binder.bind(Publisher.class);
        ...
    }
```


More documentation will follow... :)
